            <section>
                <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
                    <p>When working with vast amount of data, security will play a very important role in keeping those data from being leaked. A few ways to prevent data leak includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data encryption</li>
                        <li>Data anonymization and masking</li>
                        <li>Deleting redundant data</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Transparency</h3>
                    <p>With AI systems, having transparency insights public trust, 100% accountability, and in turn also ensure fairness. If there are any errors or issues that occur with an AI system, transparency will help in identifying who or what was responsibility as well as easier to identify the area that needs correcting. Transparency methods include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data transparency</li>
                        <li>accountability</li>
                        <li>Compliant with Ethical Guidelines</li>
                        <li>Ensure user control and transparency</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Oversight</h3>
                    <p>With so much still left to explore in the possibility of AI, there is not a complete set of rules or anything that has been agreed upon. There is also not a legislation or regulations in place to regulate the development of AI systems. Regulations to be place would include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Committee/legislation/regulations</li>
                        <li>Risk management</li>
                        <li>Regular regulation reports</li>
                        <li>Monitoring and logging</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Job displacement</h3>
                    <p>The rise of AI system have automated a series of jobs that were handled by human workers thus replacing them and removing them from the job. Those workers will be out of a job position and out of their source of income. There are methods to be put in place for those workers so they don't just become unemployed; methods including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retraining programs</li>
                        <li>Transition between jobs</li>
                        <li>New job positions</li>
                        <li>Partnering AI with human workers</li>
                        <li>Flexibilty in work schedules</li>
                    </ul>
