            <h1>Ethical Considerations</h1>
            <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
                <p>Enormous amounts of data get fed to ensure the outputs are close to very accurate. “One branch, machine learning, notable for its ability to sort and analyze massive amounts of data and to learn over time, has transformed countless fields, including education. (Pazzanese, 2020)” These are real-life data that are gathered from many applications, situations, and history. Data that can be used for malicious intent or misinformation to spread which leads to another concern</p>
            <h2>Transparency</h2>
                <p>The transparency in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is fairly limited. “There is no full explanation of many of the AI systems we have that are implemented in many industries. “AI systems often operate in a “black box”, where these systems offer limited interpretability of how they work and how they arrive at certain decisions. (CTU, 2023)” Without having full transparency in many AI systems, the responsibility becomes difficult. It leads to a lack of accountability when or if the system makes a mistake or ends up causing harm. Additionally, transparency ensures the right party takes responsibility and changes to be implemented to fix the issue caused by the system.</p>
            <h2>Oversight</h2>
                <p>Concern of oversight of the development of AI. “Given its power and expected ubiquity, some argue that the use of AI should be tightly regulated. But there's little consensus on how that should be done and who should make the rules. (Pazzanese, 2020)” There are guidelines for AI systems but there aren't regulations on how they are to be used in combination with the lack of transparency. There aren't any overseers to look over the AI developments and the systems to make sure they are working as intended with no misuse or anyone to establish a set of rules.</p>
            <h2>Job displacement</h2>
                <p>Job displacement when AI systems get introduced and replace positions. “A study by the McKinsey Global Institute reports that by 2030, at least 14% of the employees globally could need to change their careers due to digitization, robotics, and AI advancements. (Talmage-Rostron, 2024)” AI has already been replacing certain jobs that can just be automated to ensure stable quantity and quality of the job. The people's jobs that are affected would have to be provided certain measures for them to move on to other jobs instead of just firing them on the spot.
