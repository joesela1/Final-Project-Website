            <section>
                <p>AI, artificial intelligence, has evolved a significant amount from when it was first introduced back in 1950. It has helped in improving the quality of life for the human society. AI has now been implemented in many parts of society from mobile phones to applications to many jobs. An example would be Google; when you type a question in the search bar, a feature called AI Overview is the first thing that pops up in giving you information and answers to the question. AI has been incorporated so much that concerns began to arise as it has started to affect industries on a higher level.</p>
